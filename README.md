 - Since browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent scripts from reading files out of the local file system, we need to run a local web server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
or 

```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

 - This will start the server on http://localhost:8080 from the current working directory.

 - Copy and paste the address http://localhost:8000/d3.html into your browser
